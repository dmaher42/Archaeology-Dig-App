Original prompt: Implement "Lost Site Expedition" as a small MVP game mode in the Archaeology-Dig-App repo.

Notes:
- Confirmed this checkout already had an `expedition` phase wired through `src/App.jsx` and `src/components/Menu.jsx`.
- Confirmed `src/components/ExpeditionMode.jsx` existed as an untracked partial MVP, but it was hard-coded to Ancient Egypt, did not require supporting evidence selection, and did not reduce points/stamina/time from hazards.
- Canonical data remains `src/data.js` for SCENARIOS/CATEGORIES and Bureau training civilisation profiles.

TODO:
- Replaced the partial expedition component in place.
- Kept save/load scoped to existing archaeology and Bureau modes; Expedition is intentionally short-session only.
- `npm.cmd run lint` passes.
- `npm.cmd run build` passes.
- Browser/play verification covered menu entry, Expedition start, WASD/arrow movement, evidence pickup, hazard stamina loss, exit unlock, correct claim, incorrect claim, and Bureau briefing access.

Remaining notes:
- MVP target site is fixed to Ancient Egypt for this first one-level version, while the claim options are the six Bureau training civilisations.
- Future expansion could rotate the target civilisation once matching SCENARIOS evidence exists for Greece, Maya, and Inca.

2026-05-08 update:
- Added a Lost Site Expedition Run Result / Rank Screen after a complete final claim.
- Result scoring uses mission completion, civilisation claim, supporting evidence, field kit, investigation points, stamina, and time remaining.
- Result data is exposed through `window.render_game_to_text` for browser testing.

2026-05-08 update:
- Strengthened field kit effects in Lost Site Expedition.
- Base Camp now explains collected and missing tool impacts.
- Excavation now uses Field Guide hints, Notebook notes, Brush, Trowel and Camera bonuses, and the result screen shows Measuring Tape / field kit impact.

2026-05-08 update:
- Added Field Rescue restart prompts when journey or excavation hazards/monsters reduce resources to zero.
- Journey rescue offers Restart Journey or Back to Menu.
- Excavation rescue pauses the map and offers Restart Expedition or Back to Menu.

2026-05-08 update:
- Stabilised the first Evidence Hunt Mission as "Find Structural Evidence".
- Mission progress now requires 3 structural evidence items before the Exit Gate unlocks.
- Added a mission briefing before the journey stage so the mission appears as soon as Expedition starts.

2026-05-08 update:
- Added a clearer Evidence Satchel Decision panel for full inventory cases.
- The panel now shows mission details, satchel contents, the pending evidence item, and review/replace/leave choices.
- Browser verification confirmed the first mission evidence pickup and the new render state fields; the full overflow playthrough still needs a longer end-to-end check.

2026-05-08 update:
- Added and regression-tested Survey Before Digging in Lost Site Expedition.
- Evidence now starts hidden until a survey zone is marked.
- Survey zones were added for Riverbank, Burial Area, Archive Corner, Market Area, and Ruined Wall.
- Ruined Wall reveals the 3 structural mission items needed for the current Find Structural Evidence mission.
- Full Ruined Wall playthrough passed from Journey through Run Result, Play Again reset, and Back to Menu.
- `npm.cmd run build`, `npm.cmd run lint`, and `git diff --check` passed.
- Remaining risk: this pass covered one automated browser viewport; a quick classroom-device spot check is still useful before the next lesson.

2026-05-08 update:
- Added Excavation Method Choices to Lost Site Expedition after evidence is revealed by survey/grid.
- Evidence quality was added: excellent, good, or damaged.
- Field kit effects were connected: Brush and Trowel can improve method outcomes, Notebook records method notes, Camera/Field Guide effects remain in the existing flow.
- `npm.cmd run build` and `npm.cmd run lint` passed.
- Remaining risk: short browser/state checks covered the method step; a full Ruined Wall result/reset regression is still recommended before building Map recording.
